# Supergraph Configuration for Local Development
# This file defines your federated GraphQL architecture by listing all subgraphs.
#
# To use this file for local development without GraphOS:
# 1. Install rover CLI: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started
# 2. Run: rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml > data/schema.graphql
# 3. The generated schema will be used by the router container
#
# Note: The subgraph URLs below should point to your running subgraph services.
# Update these URLs to match your local development setup.
